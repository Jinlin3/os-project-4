Suggested steps
1. rufs_mkfs, rufs_init, and rufs_destroy - disk stuff
2. helper functions
3. bitmap operations
4. inode helper operations (readi and writei)
5. directory operations (HARDEST)
6. testing

Disk Size = 32MB
Block Size = 4KB
# of Blocks = Disk Size / Block Size = 8192

Layout of disk:
- Superblock
- Bitmaps
- Inode Area
- Data Blocks

Given helper functions:
- dev_init(const char* diskfile_path): creates a file which is your new emulated disk
- dev_open(const char* diskfile_path): function to open the disk file
- dev_close(): function to close the disk file
- bio_read(const int block_num, void *buf): read a block from the disk
- bio_write(const int block_num, const void *buf): write a block to the disk

Inodes:
- Represents file metadata
- Stored in inode table (blocks 3-7)
- Offset = size of inode * inode number
