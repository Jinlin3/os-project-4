1. rufs_mkfs, rufs_init, and rufs_destroy - disk stuff
2. helper functions
3. bitmap operations
4. inode helper operations (readi and writei)
5. directory operations (HARDEST)
6. Once you implement some of the helper functions, you can start using them within the rest of the rufs
functions you have to implement.
